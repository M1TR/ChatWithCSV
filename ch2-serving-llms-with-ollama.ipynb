    "- `NO_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, and `HTTPS_PROXY` are important if you intend to run Ollama inside a private network.  \n",
    "- `OLLAMA_HOST` can be set if you would like to change the port number to which Ollama listens.  \n",
    "- `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL` can be set to allow handling of simultaneous requests to the server. Based on your system resources such as CPU, RAM, and VRAM, some amount of trial and error might be needed to arrive at an optimal number for this value. Values which are too high can crash the Ollama service.  \n",
