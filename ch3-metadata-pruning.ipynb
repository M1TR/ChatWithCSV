    "\n",
    "Even though LLMs are offering longer context lengths every day, they still tend to get [lost in the middle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172), i.e. the model pays most attention to the beginning and the end of the prompt. Since we are adding our table DDL in the prompt as context and DDLs can contain tables numbering in the multiples of hundreds, it is seen that the LLM often fails to \"pick\" the relevant column names, especially if they occur in the middle of the DDL.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, we \"prune\" the DDL, i.e. we do not include all the columns but only those which we deem relevant to our question. With this shortened DDL, the LLM should have a much easier time selecting the correct column and also leaves more room in the context window for the generated SQL.\n",
